# playlist-for-rrima
GitHub is a very reasonable solution for a playlist

## Structure
- Every song gets it's own markdown file
- I'll either automate the shit out of this with APIs for artist lol or it will land on the graveyard of other projects
- let me know if you want to help implement a github playlist tool including github actions and APIs lul.
